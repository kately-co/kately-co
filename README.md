# Welcome! 🌸👩‍💻

👋 Hi, I’m Kate from [kately.co](https://kately.co) 🌱

✨ I'm a **designer** who loves merging **technology** with a more thoughtful, eco-friendly approach to life. I believe **AI** can help us all live with more **freedom** and **independence**, freeing us from the constraints of big corporations and the traditional grind. 💻✨

🐾 When I’m not designing everything from **print to digital** or coding up something new, you can find me:
- **Gardening** and playing with my **fur babies** 🐶🐱
- Dreaming of a world that balances innovation with nature 🌍💚

🌸 What I’m working on:
- Designing **tech** that’s both functional and human-centered
- Exploring how **AI** can empower individuals and foster creativity
- Crafting **startup solutions** (I’ve got lots of experience in that!)

💬 Let's chat about:
- **Design** (UI/UX, branding, etc.)
- **AI** and how it can change our world for the better
- Or anything else that sparks your interest—I’m always up for a good conversation! 😊
